## 1. Project Goals & Requirements Evolution
### Original Goals (2024)
- **Primary Goal:** Create a comprehensive system for students to explore which teachers taught which courses across different batches and semesters
- **Technical Challenge:** Build a dynamic, filterable interface that could handle complex data relationships
- **Data Integration:** Connect with official DU faculty data while maintaining flexibility for updates
- **User Experience:** Provide multiple viewing modes (Batch, Course, Teacher) with smart filtering
- **Performance:** Ensure fast, client-side operations for smooth user interaction

### Current Status (Late 2024)
- **Scalability:** Supporting 8 active batches (24th-31st) with automated systems
- **Content Management:** Template-based course page generation for 58+ subjects
- **Performance Optimization:** 83% file reduction through architectural improvements
- **Advanced UX:** Multi-mode filtering, progressive search, mobile-responsive design
- **API Integration:** Multiple API key rotation system for reliable Google Drive integration

---

## 2. Technical Architecture & Design Decisions I Made
### Frontend Structure I Built
- **Modular Sidebar:** Implemented using `data-include` for consistent navigation across all pages
- **Dynamic Filter System:** Built cascading dropdowns with context-aware visibility (semester only shows when batch is selected)
- **Multi-View Rendering:** Created three distinct view modes that share the same data but present it differently
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Started with semantic HTML structure, then enhanced with JavaScript functionality

### Key Design Decisions
- **Client-Side Processing:** Chose to parse and filter all data in the browser for instant response times
- **Data-Driven UI:** Made all dropdowns populate automatically from parsed data to avoid hardcoding
- **Separation of Concerns:** Kept data parsing, UI rendering, and event handling in separate functions
- **Responsive Design:** Built mobile-first with progressive enhancement for larger screens
- **Template System:** Implemented course page templates for consistent experience across 50+ subjects
- **API Resilience:** Multiple Google Drive API key rotation for reliable data fetching

### Current Development Status (Late 2024)
**Batch JSON Consolidation System:** Successfully migrated from 40+ individual subject JSON files to 8 consolidated batch files, achieving:
- **83% file reduction** (40+ files → 8 batch files)
- **Single-source editing** (update one batch file instead of multiple)
- **Automatic propagation** (changes instantly affect all related pages)
- **Simplified maintenance** (easier to add new batches/semesters)

**Template-Based Course Generation:** Created dynamic course page system:
- `course-template.html` for standardized course page structure
- Automatic batch container generation matching semester page styles
- Consistent UX across all 50+ subject pages
- Easy addition of new courses without code duplication

---

## 3. Data Management Strategy Evolution
### Original Hybrid Data Approach (August 2025)
I decided on a two-source data system that balances maintainability with official accuracy:

**Source 1: Raw HTML Archive (Easy Updates)**
- Embedded HTML structure (h3/h4/h5/ul) directly in the page
- Allows quick updates by editing HTML without touching JavaScript
- Follows semantic hierarchy: Batch → Semester → Course → Teachers

**Source 2: External Faculty JSON (Official Data)**
- `faculty-mapping.json` file containing official DU faculty information
- Provides positions, clean names, and sorting order
- Can be updated independently when faculty changes occur

### Revolutionary Batch JSON System (September 2025)
**Major Architectural Shift:** Completely redesigned data management with consolidated batch files:

**New Structure: Batch-Centric JSON System**
```
batches/
├── batch-24.json → batch-31.json  (Active batch data)
├── batch-template.json            (Template for new batches)
└── create_new_batch.bat          (Automated batch creation)
```

**Each Batch File Contains:**
- **Batch metadata**: name, years, contact person, faculty reference
- **Drive folder mappings**: Google Drive folder IDs for each semester
- **Complete academic data**: subjects, teachers, links, organized by semester
- **Search-optimized structure**: enables cross-batch filtering and search

**Benefits Achieved:**
- **83% reduction in files**: From 40+ individual JSONs to 8 batch files
- **Simplified updates**: Change one batch file instead of multiple separate files
- **Automatic website integration**: All pages auto-update when batch data changes
- **Easy scaling**: Add new batches without touching any code

### Enhanced API Management System
**Multiple API Key Rotation:** Implemented robust Google Drive API system:
- Automatic fallback between multiple API keys
- Error handling and retry logic
- Usage tracking to prevent quota exhaustion
- Seamless user experience even during API limits

### Data Processing Pipeline Enhancement
1. **Load Batch Data:** Dynamically fetch all batch JSON files
2. **Parse Faculty Data:** Combine with official faculty information
3. **Build Advanced Indexes:** Create Maps for efficient cross-referencing
4. **Generate Smart UI:** Populate context-aware dropdowns
5. **Enable Search:** Full-text search across all batch data

### Smart Data Structures Implementation
```javascript
// Enhanced teacher index for complex lookups
allTeachers: Map(teacherName → {
  courses: Set,
  batches: Set, 
  semesters: Set,
  sections: Set,
  totalCourses: Number
})

// Advanced course index for cross-batch analysis
allCourses: Map(courseName → {
  batches: Set,
  teachers: Set,
  semesters: Set,
  driveLinks: Map,
  descriptions: Array
})

// New batch index for systematic organization
allBatches: Map(batchNumber → {
  metadata: Object,
  semesters: Map,
  driveIds: Map,
  subjects: Array
})
```

---

## 4. Complex Rendering System I Created
### Three-View Architecture I Implemented
Each view required different data organization and presentation logic:

**Batch View (Academic Progression)**
```javascript
// My approach: Batch → Semester → Course → Teachers
// Sorted: Latest batch first, official semester order, course codes
function renderBatchView() {
  // Sort batches by recency (28th, 27th, 26th...)
  // Sort semesters by academic order (1st, 2nd, 3rd...)
  // Sort courses by course code (1101, 1102, 1103...)
  // Sort teachers by official faculty ranking
}
```

**Course View (Cross-Reference)**
```javascript
// My approach: Semester → Course → Batch → Teachers  
// Groups same courses across different batches/semesters
function renderCourseView() {
  // Group by semester to show course evolution
  // Show which batches took each course
  // Display all teachers who taught it
}
```

**Teacher View (Individual Profiles)**
```javascript
// My approach: Teacher → Courses → Batch/Semester Tags
// Shows complete teaching portfolio for each faculty
function renderTeacherView() {
  // Sort teachers by official university ranking
  // List all courses taught with context tags
  // Show section assignments (A, B, C...)
}
```

### Smart Filtering Logic I Built
- **Contextual Controls:** Semester dropdown only appears when needed
- **Cross-Filter Updates:** All dropdowns update based on current data subset
- **Reset Functionality:** One-click return to default state
- **Real-time Rendering:** Instant view updates without page reload
