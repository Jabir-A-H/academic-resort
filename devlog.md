# Academic Resort — Technical Development Documentation

## Overview
This document describes how I built the Academic Resort web application, specifically focusing on the complex Teachers' Profiles page (`course-teachers.html`). This page was one of the most challenging parts of the project, requiring dynamic data parsing, multiple view modes, and integration with official university faculty data.

---

## 1. Project Goals & Requirements I Set
- **Primary Goal:** Create a comprehensive system for students to explore which teachers taught which courses across different batches and semesters
- **Technical Challenge:** Build a dynamic, filterable interface that could handle complex data relationships
- **Data Integration:** Connect with official DU faculty data while maintaining flexibility for updates
- **User Experience:** Provide multiple viewing modes (Batch, Course, Teacher) with smart filtering
- **Performance:** Ensure fast, client-side operations for smooth user interaction

---

## 2. Technical Architecture & Design Decisions I Made
### Frontend Structure I Built
- **Modular Sidebar:** Implemented using `data-include` for consistent navigation across all pages
- **Dynamic Filter System:** Built cascading dropdowns with context-aware visibility (semester only shows when batch is selected)
- **Multi-View Rendering:** Created three distinct view modes that share the same data but present it differently
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Started with semantic HTML structure, then enhanced with JavaScript functionality

### Key Design Decisions
- **Client-Side Processing:** Chose to parse and filter all data in the browser for instant response times
- **Data-Driven UI:** Made all dropdowns populate automatically from parsed data to avoid hardcoding
- **Separation of Concerns:** Kept data parsing, UI rendering, and event handling in separate functions
- **Responsive Design:** Built mobile-first with progressive enhancement for larger screens

---

## 3. Data Management Strategy I Developed
### Hybrid Data Approach I Chose
I decided on a two-source data system that balances maintainability with official accuracy:

**Source 1: Raw HTML Archive (Easy Updates)**
- Embedded HTML structure (h3/h4/h5/ul) directly in the page
- Allows quick updates by editing HTML without touching JavaScript
- Follows semantic hierarchy: Batch → Semester → Course → Teachers

**Source 2: External Faculty JSON (Official Data)**
- `faculty-mapping.json` file containing official DU faculty information
- Provides positions, clean names, and sorting order
- Can be updated independently when faculty changes occur

### Data Processing Pipeline I Built
1. **Parse HTML Archive:** Extract batch/semester/course/teacher relationships
2. **Load Faculty Data:** Fetch official faculty information from JSON
3. **Build Indexes:** Create Maps for teachers and courses for efficient lookups
4. **Normalize Names:** Clean teacher names for robust matching
5. **Generate UI:** Populate dropdowns and render initial view

### Smart Data Structures I Implemented
```javascript
// Teacher index for quick lookups
allTeachers: Map(teacherName → {
  courses: Set,
  batches: Set, 
  semesters: Set
})

// Course index for cross-referencing
allCourses: Map(courseName → {
  batches: Set,
  teachers: Set,
  semesters: Set
})
```

## 4. Complex Rendering System I Created
### Three-View Architecture I Implemented
Each view required different data organization and presentation logic:

**Batch View (Academic Progression)**
```javascript
// My approach: Batch → Semester → Course → Teachers
// Sorted: Latest batch first, official semester order, course codes
function renderBatchView() {
  // Sort batches by recency (28th, 27th, 26th...)
  // Sort semesters by academic order (1st, 2nd, 3rd...)
  // Sort courses by course code (1101, 1102, 1103...)
  // Sort teachers by official faculty ranking
}
```

**Course View (Cross-Reference)**
```javascript
// My approach: Semester → Course → Batch → Teachers  
// Groups same courses across different batches/semesters
function renderCourseView() {
  // Group by semester to show course evolution
  // Show which batches took each course
  // Display all teachers who taught it
}
```

**Teacher View (Individual Profiles)**
```javascript
// My approach: Teacher → Courses → Batch/Semester Tags
// Shows complete teaching portfolio for each faculty
function renderTeacherView() {
  // Sort teachers by official university ranking
  // List all courses taught with context tags
  // Show section assignments (A, B, C...)
}
```

### Smart Filtering Logic I Built
- **Contextual Controls:** Semester dropdown only appears when needed
- **Cross-Filter Updates:** All dropdowns update based on current data subset
- **Reset Functionality:** One-click return to default state
- **Real-time Rendering:** Instant view updates without page reload

---

## 5. Technical Challenges I Solved
### Name Normalization Problem
**Challenge:** Teacher names appear inconsistently ("Dr. John Smith" vs "John Smith" vs "Prof. John Smith")
**My Solution:** Built a robust normalization function that strips titles and handles variations
```javascript
function normalizeName(name) {
  // Remove academic titles, professional designations
  // Handle multiple formats and edge cases
  // Return clean name for consistent matching
}
```

### Faculty Data Integration Challenge  
**Challenge:** Connect course data with official university faculty information
**My Solution:** Created external JSON mapping with fallback handling
- Official faculty get proper positions and sorting order
- Visiting/guest teachers get default categorization
- System gracefully handles missing data

### Performance Optimization Challenge
**Challenge:** Complex filtering across large datasets could be slow
**My Solution:** 
- Parse data once on load, not on every filter change
- Use JavaScript Maps and Sets for O(1) lookups
- Render only visible content, hide others with CSS
- Debounce rapid filter changes

### Mobile Responsiveness Challenge
**Challenge:** Complex multi-dropdown interface needed to work on phones
**My Solution:**
- Progressive disclosure (show only relevant controls)
- Touch-friendly button sizes and spacing
- Responsive grid layout for course cards
- Collapsible sections for better mobile navigation

## 6. Code Organization & Best Practices I Followed
### Modular JavaScript Architecture
I organized the code into logical sections:
```javascript
// 1. Data Management
let allBatches = [];
let allTeachers = new Map();
let allCourses = new Map();
let facultyData = {};

// 2. Utility Functions  
function normalizeName(name) { ... }
function getFacultyInfo(teacherName) { ... }
function sortTeachersByOrder(teachers) { ... }

// 3. Data Processing
function loadFacultyData() { ... }
function parseArchive(archiveElement) { ... }

// 4. UI Rendering
function renderBatchView(...) { ... }
function renderCourseView(...) { ... }
function renderTeacherView(...) { ... }

// 5. Event Handling
function handleFilterChange() { ... }
function resetFilters() { ... }
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when faculty data fails to load
- Console warnings for malformed data
- Fallback values for missing information
- User-friendly error states

### Accessibility Implementation  
- Semantic HTML structure with proper headings
- All form controls have associated labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly content organization
