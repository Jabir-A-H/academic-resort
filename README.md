## 🔧 Setup & Development

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Local development server (optional but recommended)

### Local Development
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jabir-A-H/academic-resort.git
   cd academic-resort
   ```

2. **Start a local server** (recommended for development):
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Open in browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```


### Configuration

#### Google Drive API Setup
The site uses a sophisticated multi-key Google Drive API system for reliable resource fetching:

```javascript
// Multi-key rotation system in assets/api-keys.js
const API_KEYS = [
  'primary_key_here',
  'secondary_key_here', 
  'tertiary_key_here'
];
// Automatic failover ensures 99% uptime
```

#### Batch Data Management
Academic resources are now organized using the consolidated batch JSON system in `batches/`:

```json
// Example: batches/batch-28.json
{
  "batch_name": "28th Batch",
  "batch_year": "2021-2025",
  "last_updated": "2025-09-23",
  "drive_folders": {
    "1st": "1hbZPTPxzgyrwVzeUVCljT72E6Scsx303",
    "2nd": "1PSQngE3zPIOhrct_iZfwjMhUpSgKPonj"
  },
  "semesters": {
    "1st": {
      "subjects": [
        {
          "code": "1101",
          "title": "Introduction to Financial Accounting",
          "teacher": "Dr. Jane Smith",
          "links": { ... }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Template System
Course pages are generated using the standardized template system:
- `assets/course-template.html` - Base template for all course pages
- Automatic batch container generation matching semester page styles
- Dynamic configuration injection for each subject
- Consistent UX across all 50+ course pages
